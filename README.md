# Question Answering on the Facebook bAbI dataset

We trained various neural network models to answer tasks in the [Facebook bAbI dataset](https://research.facebook.com/researchers/1543934539189348). We use [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) to build our models, and [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) pre-trained word vectors.
